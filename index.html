    Your listing isn’t just a space — it’s a story.  
    <br><br>
    We create scroll-stopping, story-first content designed to turn attention into bookings, and browsers into guests.

<section class="who-we-are">
  <h2>WE’RE UNIFIED</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ccc;">
    A content studio built for the hosts, operators, and hospitality brands who think beyond the listing.  
    We’re launching a new system that helps you build your brand, capture guest leads, and turn every scroll into desire.  
    <br><br>
    Our background is in storytelling, content virality, and funnel psychology. Now we’re turning that into an engine for elite property brands.
  </p>

<section class="gallery">
  <h2>WHY THIS MATTERS</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ccc;">
    Guests don’t just book based on price. They book based on *feeling*.
    <br><br>
    They want to see themselves in your space before they ever click “reserve.”
    That’s what we make possible — through story-first content and direct booking funnels built to convert.
    <br><br>
    We're not building a service. We're building a category-defining tool for the next wave of independent hospitality.

  <h2>WHY WE’RE DOING THIS (NOW)</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ccc;">
    We’re building our portfolio with care. That means we’re offering something wild — 
    <strong>1 free sample campaign</strong> for each host we onboard while slots last.
    <br><br>
    We’ll create a fully customized short-form video + guest funnel system for your listing — normally priced at $750+ — completely free.
    <br><br>
    The only ask? Let us use your results to showcase what’s possible.

  <h2>THE UNIFIED SYSTEM</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 720px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ccc;">
    We’ve distilled everything we know about storytelling, short-form content, and guest psychology into a system.
    <br><br>
    One that transforms your listing into a magnetic experience people want to book — and share.
  </p>
  <div class="steps" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <div class="step">
      <strong>1. Story Mining</strong>
      <p>We start by understanding your property’s personality — its location, vibe, and guest dream.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>2. Visual Alchemy</strong>
      <p>Then we craft a scroll-stopping, TikTok-native short-form story. No shoots needed — just imagination + design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>3. Funnel Layer</strong>
      <p>We build a custom link-in-bio funnel + guest magnet opt-in. Not just content — an actual system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>4. Light the Spark</strong>
      <p>Your story goes live. We push with organic + boosted strategies to drive eyes → clicks → leads.</p>

  <h2>THE END RESULT?</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ccc;">
    You don’t just have another post — you have a narrative.
    <br><br>
    Something that guests remember. Something they share.  
    A system that brings in leads while you're offline.  
    A reason for people to choose you, not the algorithm’s favorite.
